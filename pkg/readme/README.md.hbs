## Why?

Cortez is a graph data structure written in ES6 decoupling structure from content to allow merging of different graphs and concurrent graph modification in a distributed environment.

The aim of this library is to provide a performant proxy to work with relatively smaller subsets of huge graphs persisted in databases in a distributed architecture. Cortez should eventually make it possible to extract a fragment of a bigger graph, work on it by adding/removing/updating nodes or edges and then apply the changes to the original graph.

The library is currently at a very early stage.



# Features / Usage

The ES5 code is in the dist folder, while the src folder contains the ES6 sources.

Plain and generator-based versions of all query and graph traversal methods.

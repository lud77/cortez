## Roadmap

I plan to improve this package and its brother package [express-react-toolchain](https://github.com/lud77/express-react-toolchain) with the addition of many features. Among those:

- invoke.sh script (Bash equivalent of the invoke.bat script)
- automated download of feeds from activity streams of project management software to generate HISTORY.md files

Since the main focus here is avoiding feature bloat, many aspects will be left out of this package, including facilities for transpilation and modules managing Promises. Some of those aspects however, especially transpilation, are addressed in [express-react-toolchain](https://github.com/lud77/express-react-toolchain).
